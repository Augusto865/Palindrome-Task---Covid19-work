A check to see if RACECAR and DEFIED are palindromes

How to check if RACECAR is a palindrome?

R    A   C   E  C   A   R 

C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6

firstly, we need to know its length (7 LETTERS)
Secondly, we work out the midpoint of the word RACECAR. 
formula = Mod(L/2-1)
so for RACECAR - the midpoint (7/2-1) is 2
i = 0 (i is the value of the charcter) - for a 7 letter word like racecar C0 - R and C1 - A etc.
so for a word to be a palindrome the letter at the start of the word has to equal the letter at the end

The formula for this is: Ci = CL - i - 1
Ci is 0
CL is 7
i is 0
so we have: 0 = 6 which is true 0 is R and 6 is also R
Now we do the same with the other letters in RACECAR.

Ci = CL - i - 1
Ci is now 1 (we have already compared the first value so we move to the next.)
CL is still 7
i is 1
Now we have 1 = 5 which again is true as C1 is A and C5 is A 

# A WORD IS ONLY A PALINDROME IF: i ≥ M(midpoint)

For the next letter 
Ci = CL - i - 1
Ci is now 2 
CL is still 7
i is 2
So we get 2 = 4 which yet again is true as C2 is C and C4 is C

HOWEVER NOW i is 2 like the midpoint ( 2≥2) making RACECAR a palindrome






How to check if DEFIED is a palindrome?

Easy, we use the same method

D   E    F   I   E  D 
C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5

Length is 6 letters
so midpoint is Mod(6/2-1) = 2 (no MOD in this case)

i to begin is 0
Ci = CL - i - 1
CO = 6 - 0 - 1
C0 = C5 
Which is true ( D does equal to D at the other end)

i is now 1
C1 = CL - i - 1
C1 = 6 - 1 - i
C1 = 5
Which is true as (E does equal to E at the other end

i is now 2
C2 = CL - i - 1
C2 = 6 - 2 - 1
C2 = C3
HOWEVER this isn't the case:  (C2 is F and C3 is I) - So cannot be a PALNDROME
